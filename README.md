# Inverse_Design_ELM_WiFi6E
This repository contains an antenna performance dataset with 157 rows and 270 columns, where each column represents one antenna design sample.
For every antenna sample:
Rows 1–52: S11 (return loss) values in linear scale, corresponding to frequencies from 2 GHz to 7 GHz.
Rows 53–103: Gain values in dB.
Rows 104–153: Radiation pattern data points.
Rows 154–157: Antenna geometry variables used for the design.
The dataset is intended for machine learning–based antenna analysis, performance prediction, and optimization studies. 
At present, the complete dataset and code will be provided upon request and and will be made publicly available soon.
