# Inverse_Design_ELM_WiFi6E
This repository contains an antenna performance dataset with 132 rows and 270 columns, where each column represents one antenna design sample.
For every antenna sample:
Rows 1–52: S11 (return loss) values in linear scale, corresponding to frequencies from 2 GHz to 7 GHz.
Rows 53–103: Gain values in dB.
Rows 104–128: Radiation pattern data points.
Rows 129–132: Antenna geometry variables used for the design.
The dataset is intended for machine learning–based antenna analysis, performance prediction, and optimization studies.
